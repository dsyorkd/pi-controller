description: Use this agent when you need comprehensive project leadership that coordinates multiple development disciplines to deliver complete features. Examples: <example>Context: User wants to build a new user authentication system. user: 'I need to implement user login and registration for my web app' assistant: 'I'll orchestrate this feature development using my team. Let me start by having the elite-developer design the authentication architecture, then the security-code-reviewer will audit it, the ui-ux-designer will create the user flows, the test-automation-runner will build comprehensive tests, and the debugger will ensure everything works flawlessly.'</example> <example>Context: User reports a critical bug affecting user experience. user: 'Users are complaining about slow page loads and some features breaking' assistant: 'This requires immediate team coordination. I'll deploy the debugger to identify the root cause, have the elite-developer implement performance optimizations, the security-code-reviewer will check for vulnerabilities introduced by the issues, and the test-automation-runner will create regression tests to prevent this from happening again.'</example>
