# Product Requirements Document: Comprehensive Unit Test Coverage

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a project to increase the unit test coverage of the Pi-Controller codebase. The goal is to create a robust suite of unit tests that ensures the correctness and stability of individual components, without relying on external dependencies or infrastructure.

## 2. Rationale

Currently, the Pi-Controller project has a growing codebase, but the test coverage is not comprehensive. A solid foundation of unit tests is crucial for:

- **Preventing Regressions:** Ensuring that new changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Improving Code Quality:** Writing tests often reveals issues with code structure and design.
- **Facilitating Refactoring:** Allowing developers to refactor code with confidence.
- **Developer Confidence:** Providing a safety net for developers to make changes and additions.

## 3. Scope

This project will focus exclusively on writing **unit tests**. The following are the key characteristics of the tests to be written:

- **Isolation:** Tests should be isolated and not depend on the state of other tests.
- **No External API Calls:** Tests must not make any calls to external APIs or services. This includes Kubernetes APIs, cloud provider APIs, or any other third-party services. Mocks and stubs should be used to simulate these interactions.
- **No File System Interaction:** Tests should not interact with the file system for operations like reading or writing files. If file system interaction is necessary, it should be mocked.
- **Focus on Business Logic:** The primary focus should be on testing the business logic within functions and methods.

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1. General Requirements

- All new tests must be written in Go, following the existing testing patterns and conventions in the project.
- Tests should be placed in the same package as the code they are testing, in a file with the `_test.go` suffix.
- Tests should be well-documented, with clear and descriptive names that indicate what they are testing.
- The existing test suite must continue to pass after the new tests are added.

### 4.2. Areas for Test Coverage

The following is a non-exhaustive list of areas that require improved test coverage. The goal is to cover all packages and components that are not already covered by tests.

- **`internal/api/handlers`:** All HTTP handlers should be tested to ensure they correctly handle requests and responses.
- **`internal/api/middleware`:** All middleware should be tested to ensure they correctly modify the request context and handle errors.
- **`internal/config`:** The configuration loading and parsing logic should be tested.
- **`internal/services`:** All business logic within the services should be thoroughly tested.
- **`internal/storage`:** The database interaction logic should be tested, using mocks for the database connection.
- **`internal/websocket`:** The WebSocket server logic should be tested.
- **`pkg/discovery`:** The mDNS discovery logic should be tested.
- **`pkg/gpio`:** The GPIO controller logic should be tested.
- **`pkg/k8s`:** The Kubernetes client logic should be tested, using a fake client.

### 4.3. Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for this project:

- **Integration Tests:** Tests that involve multiple components interacting with each other.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Tests that simulate a full user workflow.
- **Performance Tests:** Tests that measure the performance of the system.
- **Tests Requiring a Running Kubernetes Cluster:** All tests should be able to run without a Kubernetes cluster.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- Unit test coverage is significantly increased across the codebase.
- All new tests are written in accordance with the requirements outlined in this document.
- The entire test suite runs successfully without any failures.
- The new tests are integrated into the existing CI/CD pipeline.
