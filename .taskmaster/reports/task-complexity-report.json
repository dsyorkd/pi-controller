			"expansionPrompt": "Analyze the `internal/services` package to identify all public service structs (e.g., `DeploymentService`, `PinService`). Create a comprehensive set of subtasks for writing unit tests for this package. The subtasks should follow this structure:\n1. A single, foundational subtask to create mock implementations for all external dependencies of the services (e.g., `storage.Store`, `k8s.Client`) using the `testify/mock` library. This subtask must be a dependency for all subsequent testing subtasks.\n2. For each identified service, create two distinct subtasks:\na. 'Write Unit Tests for `<ServiceName>` Success Scenarios': This subtask should focus on testing the 'happy path' where all dependencies behave as expected.\nb. 'Write Unit Tests for `<ServiceName>` Error Handling and Edge Cases': This subtask should focus on testing the service's resilience by simulating dependency failures, invalid inputs, and other non-ideal conditions.",
			"reasoning": "Complexity (6/10): The task involves testing a critical orchestration layer, requiring careful mocking of multiple external dependencies (storage, K8s) and comprehensive coverage of success, error, and edge cases. While the pattern is standard, the thoroughness required for a core package elevates its complexity beyond simple unit testing. Recommended Subtasks (5): The existing breakdown is ideal and follows best practices. It establishes a foundational task for mocks and then separates testing by service and by scenario type (success vs. error). This modular approach improves clarity, focuses testing efforts, and is easily scalable if more services are added to the package. Assuming two services, 5 subtasks is the correct number."
