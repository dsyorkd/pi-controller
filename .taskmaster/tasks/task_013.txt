# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Structured Logging and Error Handling
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the codebase to use a structured logging library (e.g., `slog` or `zerolog`) and establish consistent error handling patterns, including error wrapping.
# Details:
Replace all `fmt.Printf` and `log.Println` calls with a configured structured logger. Implement a standard pattern for wrapping errors with context using `fmt.Errorf` with `%w`. Define custom error types for the service layer.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test error-producing functions to verify that errors are wrapped correctly. Manually inspect application logs during operation to confirm they are structured (e.g., JSON format) and contain contextual information.
