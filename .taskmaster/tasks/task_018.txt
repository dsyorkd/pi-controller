# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Pi Agent System Metrics Collection
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add functionality to the Pi Agent to collect and report system metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and core temperature.
# Details:
Use a library like `gopsutil/gopsutil` to gather system metrics. Expose this data via a new gRPC service endpoint that the controller can poll or stream.

# Test Strategy:
Run the agent on a Raspberry Pi and call the metrics gRPC endpoint. Compare the returned values with the output of standard Linux commands like `top`, `free`, and `vcgencmd measure_temp` to verify accuracy.
