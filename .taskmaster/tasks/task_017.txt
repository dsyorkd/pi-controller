# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Pi Agent GPIO Control Logic
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core GPIO control functionality within the Pi Agent, including digital I/O and PWM, using a hardware abstraction library.
# Details:
Integrate the `periph.io/x/periph` library for hardware access. Implement gRPC service handlers on the agent to set pin levels (HIGH/LOW), read pin states, and configure PWM output (frequency, duty cycle).

# Test Strategy:
Requires testing on actual Raspberry Pi hardware. Write a test client to send gRPC requests to the agent and verify pin voltage changes with a multimeter or oscilloscope. Mock the `periph.io` library for unit tests.
