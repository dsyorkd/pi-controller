# Task ID: 12
# Title: Install and Configure `golangci-lint`
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate `golangci-lint` into the project to enforce a consistent and high-quality coding standard. Configure the linter with a standard set of rules.
# Details:
Add a `.golangci.yml` configuration file to the project root. Enable linters such as `errcheck`, `govet`, `staticcheck`, `unused`, and `gofmt`. Integrate the linter into the CI/CD pipeline to fail builds on linting errors.

# Test Strategy:
Run `golangci-lint run` on the codebase. The command should execute successfully. Create a sample pull request with a linting error to verify that the CI check fails as expected.
