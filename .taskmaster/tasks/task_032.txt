# Task ID: 32
# Title: Implement GPIO Control Panel with WebSocket Updates
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 19, 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a UI component for controlling a node's GPIO pins and displaying their real-time status using WebSockets.
# Details:
Develop a visual representation of the GPIO header. Implement API calls to set pin modes and states. Establish a WebSocket connection to the controller to receive real-time updates on pin state changes and display them in the UI.

# Test Strategy:
In component tests, mock the WebSocket server to send state change messages and verify that the UI updates accordingly. Manually test against a live controller and a real Raspberry Pi to confirm end-to-end functionality.
