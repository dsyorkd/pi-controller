# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Kubernetes Controller Reconciliation Loop
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 19, 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the reconciliation loop for the `GPIOPin` CRD that watches for changes and calls the Pi Controller's service to enact hardware changes.
# Details:
Using `controller-runtime`, implement the `Reconcile` function. This function will fetch the `GPIOPin` resource, determine the target node, and call the appropriate GPIO service method (which in turn makes a gRPC call) to match the hardware state to the `spec`.

# Test Strategy:
Write integration tests using `envtest`. Create a `GPIOPin` resource in the test environment and verify that the reconciler calls a mocked version of the GPIO service with the correct parameters.
