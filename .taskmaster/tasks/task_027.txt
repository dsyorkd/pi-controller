# Task ID: 27
# Title: Develop K3s Provisioning Scripts and Logic
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the logic and scripts required to install K3s on a target node and have it join a cluster.
# Details:
The provisioner service will use the SSH client to connect to a node. It will execute commands to download and run the official K3s installation script (`curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -`). It will manage join tokens for adding new nodes to an existing cluster.

# Test Strategy:
Test against a set of virtual machines (e.g., using Vagrant or cloud VMs). Run the provisioning process and verify that a multi-node K3s cluster is successfully created and all nodes are in a 'Ready' state.
