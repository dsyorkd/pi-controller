# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement Secure SSH Client
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a robust SSH client within the provisioner service for executing commands and transferring files to nodes.
# Details:
Use the `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` package. The client should support key-based authentication, connection pooling, and have built-in retry logic for transient network errors.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests that connect to a mock SSH server. Test command execution, file transfer (SFTP), and error handling for connection failures.
