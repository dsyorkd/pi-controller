# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement Certificate Authority and Node Certificate Management
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a simple Certificate Authority (CA) within the controller to issue and manage TLS certificates for agents and internal services.
# Details:
Create a root CA certificate and key on first startup. Implement gRPC endpoints for Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs). When a new node registers, it will submit a CSR, and the controller will sign it, returning a valid client certificate.

# Test Strategy:
Write a unit test that generates a CSR, calls the signing endpoint, and validates the returned certificate against the CA's public key. Verify certificate fields like Common Name and expiration.
