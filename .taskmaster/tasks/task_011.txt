# Task ID: 11
# Title: Fix All `go vet` Errors
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Address all existing compilation and static analysis errors reported by `go vet`, including logger type mismatches, undefined constants, and incorrect test imports.
# Details:
Scan the entire codebase using the `go vet ./...` command. Systematically fix each reported issue. This is a prerequisite for establishing a clean baseline for code quality.

# Test Strategy:
Run `go vet ./...` and confirm it returns no errors. Ensure the project compiles successfully with `go build ./...` and all existing tests pass with `go test ./...`.
