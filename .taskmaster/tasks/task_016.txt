# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Pi Agent gRPC Client Communication
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the gRPC client within the Pi Agent to establish communication with the Pi Controller server.
# Details:
Use the existing protobuf definitions to generate gRPC client code. Implement logic for the agent to connect to the controller, handle connection retries with exponential backoff, and send a registration or heartbeat message.

# Test Strategy:
Create a mock gRPC server to test the agent's client. Verify that the agent can connect, send messages, and handle server disconnections gracefully.
