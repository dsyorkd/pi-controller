# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement GPIO Pin Reservation and Conflict Resolution
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a mechanism within the controller to reserve GPIO pins for specific tasks and prevent conflicting configurations.
# Details:
Add a 'reserved_by' field to the GPIO model in the database. When a request to use a pin is made, the service layer must check if it's already reserved. Implement logic to handle and report conflicts.

# Test Strategy:
Write service-level unit tests. Test scenarios where two clients attempt to reserve the same pin, attempt to use a reserved pin, and successfully release a pin.
