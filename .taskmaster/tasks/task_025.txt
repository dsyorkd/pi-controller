# Task ID: 25
# Title: Integrate `client-go` for Kubernetes API Communication
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate the official Kubernetes `client-go` library into the Pi Controller to enable interaction with the Kubernetes API server.
# Details:
Add the `k8s.io/client-go` dependency. Implement logic to create a `clientset` using in-cluster or out-of-cluster configuration. This will be used by the Kubernetes controller component to watch and update CRDs.

# Test Strategy:
Write a simple test program that uses the `client-go` integration to connect to a test K3s cluster and list all pods in the `kube-system` namespace. This verifies connectivity and authentication.
