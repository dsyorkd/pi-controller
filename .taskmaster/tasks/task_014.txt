# Task ID: 14
# Title: Complete Database Migration System
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a robust database migration system to manage schema changes for the SQLite database.
# Details:
Use a library like `golang-migrate/migrate` or `pressly/goose`. Create initial migration scripts for the existing database models. The system should support applying and rolling back migrations.

# Test Strategy:
Create a unit test that initializes an in-memory SQLite database, runs all 'up' migrations, and verifies the schema. Then, run all 'down' migrations and confirm the database is returned to its initial state.
